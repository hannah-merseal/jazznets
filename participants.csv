Concerns: a few of my sequences did not play clearly - around number 250 (approx.) - I wasn't sure if this was intentional so my perception for a few of these sequences was definitely off. 

Perhaps timed breaks are more effective? I found that giving myself longer breaks made the next set of sequences easier to hear as I'd given my brain/ears ample time to reset.

Whatever the outcome, I think my progress definitely deteriorated the further into the test I went. It became harder to differentiate everything and think clearly.",36,"JN_36",1
